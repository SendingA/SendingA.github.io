Thrilled to share that I have achieved a **perfect 4.0 GPA** in all three courses during my first semester as a Ph.D. student at **Michigan State University**!

This accomplishment marks a strong start to my doctoral journey. Grateful for the guidance from my advisor Prof. Qiben Yan and the supportive academic environment at MSU's Computer Science Department.
