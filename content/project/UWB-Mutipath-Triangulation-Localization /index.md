title: Single Anchor Ultra-Wideband Multipath Triangulation Localization (SOLO)
summary: 
  A UWB multipath triangulate localization algorithm is proposed and achieved , including the generation of UWB signal and the channel model, the extract of CIR, the obtainment of AOA, AOD, rTOF and the localization algorithm. The simulation is initially verified successfully.
