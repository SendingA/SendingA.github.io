Ending 2025 on a high note! 🎉 

I am excited to announce that I have submitted a paper to the **IEEE INFOCOM 2026 EIN Workshop** as the **sole first author**! 

This work represents my independent research efforts and marks an important milestone in my early Ph.D. career. Looking forward to sharing more details once the review process concludes.
