title: AttackDeceiver Anti-spoofing Automotive Radar System using an Interleaving Chirp Waveform
summary: 
  We present a novel anti-spoofing system called AttackDeceiver that enables resilient surrounding environment sensing under various spoofing attacks via an interleaving chirp waveform.AttackDeceiver leverages the comparison of estimates between the two channels, effectively detecting and mitigating false targets injected by malicious users. In addition, we deceive the attacker into generating unreasonable spoofing velocity for the injected targets.The experimental results reveal an impressive false target recall (FTR) over 95%, along with an enhancement in real target to the false target plus noise ratio (RFNR) exceeding 10 dB.
