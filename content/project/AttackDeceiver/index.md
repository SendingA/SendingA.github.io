title: Radar-Immune Enabling Radar-to-Radar Parallel Interference Cancellation using Phase Modulation
summary: 
  In this paper, we present Radar-Immune, a novel parallel interference cancellation system. Radar-Immune leverages phase
  modulation of two chirp sequences, effectively distinguishing the interfering signal from the reflected signal in the Doppler
  domain. Additionally, we introduce an intersection algorithm to cancel parallel interference. We implement Radar-Immune and
  conduct performance evaluations for interference cancellation. Experimental results demonstrate an impressive interference
  cancellation rate of up to 97%.
