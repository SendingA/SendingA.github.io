abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) radars are indispens
 able components of safety-critical advanced driver assistance
 systems, enabling accurate and weather-resilient environmental
 sensing for autonomous vehicles. Despite the advanced sensing
 capabilities, mmWave radars remain susceptible to adversarial
 attacks, where malicious users attempt to distort the sensing
 results of victim radars, leading to hazardous driving behaviors.
 While existing anti-spoofing techniques have been proposed to
 mitigate specific attacks, they may be ineffective against adaptive
 adversaries. To address this critical vulnerability, we introduce
 AttackDeceiver, a novel anti-spoofing system using a phase
 shifted interleaving waveform. By comparing range and velocity
 estimates from two independent virtual channels, our system
 effectively detects and mitigates the effects of spoofing attacks.
 In addition, we proactively counter adaptive spoofing attacks
 by inducing attackers to generate false targets with unrealistic
 velocity fluctuations. A compact prototype of AttackDeceiver is
 realized using commercial-off-the-shelf radar kits. Experimental
 results demonstrate the effectiveness of our system, achieving a
 remarkable false target recall exceeding 97.9% and a significant
 enhancement in signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio exceeding
 13.46dB.
