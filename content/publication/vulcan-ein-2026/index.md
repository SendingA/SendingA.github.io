abstract: This paper presents VULCAN, a Vision-Language-Model enhanced framework for multi-agent cooperative navigation in indoor fire-disaster response scenarios. By integrating state-of-the-art vision-language models with multi-agent coordination mechanisms, VULCAN enables efficient and adaptive navigation strategies for emergency response robots operating in complex and hazardous environments.
