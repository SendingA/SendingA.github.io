title: Capacitated Arc Routing Problem Project
summary: 
  Complete the CARP through genetic algorithm with heuristics and Merge-Split Operators.The solver uses a memetic algorithm and hybrid metaheuristic approach to produce high-quality solutions efficiently. The solver achieved optimal solutions in small and medium-sized instances within 180 seconds and produced comparable results for larger instances with up to 255 vertices and 347 routes.
